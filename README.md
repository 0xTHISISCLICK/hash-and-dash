# Hash && Dash

This is the repository backing a 100-piece collection of generative drawings using the token's addresses as seed. The collection was created using p5js, some salt and a bit of luck! 1800x1800px, released exclusively on the Solana Blockchain by Christin Penz. Each generative script's SHA-256 fingerprint can be found in transaction history of the respective token.

# How to generate

1. On your machine

Pull the repository and run `src/hash_dash.html` in a browser of your choice. Adjust the token constant in  `src/hash_dash.js` to the actual token value.

2. Online using p5js editor
